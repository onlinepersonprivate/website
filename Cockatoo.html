        <p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Cockatoos are a group</b> of medium to large-sized parrots that are known for their distinctive crests<br>
            and vibrant plumage. These birds are native to the warm and temperate regions of Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands.<br> 
            Cockatoos are social birds that thrive in flocks, and they are often found in open forests, woodlands, and grasslands.<br> 
            They are also known for their playful and affectionate nature, making them popular pets among bird enthusiasts.
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">One of the most striking features of cockatoos is their crest, which is made up of feathers<br> 
            that can be raised and lowered at will. This crest is often used for communication, and different species of cockatoos<br> 
            have distinct crest patterns and behaviors. Cockatoos are also known for their loud, screeching calls, which can be<br> 
            heard for miles. In the wild, these calls are used for communication and warning other cockatoos of potential threats.
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">In captivity, cockatoos are known for their intelligence and ability to mimic human speech.<br> 
            They are also known for their playful and curious nature, and they require a lot of attention and social interaction<br> 
            to thrive. Cockatoos are also known for their love of attention and affection, and they often form strong bonds with<br> 
            their owners. However, they can also be quite demanding and require a lot of care and attention, making them a<br> 
            significant commitment for any potential owner.
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Despite their popularity as pets, cockatoos are also an important part of their native<br> 
            ecosystems. In the wild, they play a crucial role in seed dispersal and forest regeneration, and they are an<br> 
            important food source for many other animals. Cockatoos are also known for their unique mating rituals, which<br> 
            involve elaborate displays of courtship and preening. Overall, cockatoos are fascinating birds that are both<br> 
            beautiful and intelligent, and they continue to capture the hearts of bird enthusiasts around the world.
