        <p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Wild budgerigars average</b> 18cm &#40;7in&#41; long, weigh 30&ndash;40 grams &#40;1.1&ndash;1.4oz&#41;,<br> 
            30cm &#40;12in&#41; in wingspan, and display a light green body colour &#40;abdomen and<br> 
            rumps&#41;, while their mantles &#40;back and wing coverts&#41; display pitch-black mantle<br> 
            markings &#40;blackish in fledglings and immatures&#41; edged in clear yellow<br> 
            undulations. The forehead and face is yellow in adults.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Prior to their adult plumage, young individuals have blackish stripes down to<br> 
            the cere &#40;the area containing the nostrils&#41; in young individuals until around<br> 
            3&ndash;4 months of age. They display small, iridescent blue-violet cheek patches<br> 
            and a series of three black spots across each side of their throats &#40;called throat<br> 
            patches&#41;. The two outermost throat spots are situated at the base of each cheek<br> 
            patch. The tail is cobalt &#40;dark-blue&#41;; and outside tail feathers display central<br> 
            yellow flashes. Their wings have greenish-black flight feathers and black<br> 
            coverts with yellow fringes along with central yellow flashes, which only become<br> 
            visible in flight or when the wings are outstretched. Bills are olive grey and legs<br> 
            blueish-grey, with zygodactyl toes.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">In their natural Australian habitat, budgerigars are noticeably smaller than those in<br> 
            captivity. This particular parrot species has been bred in many other colours and<br> 
            shades in captivity &#40;e.g. blue, grey, grey-green, pieds, violet, white, yellow-blue&#41;. Pet<br>
            store individuals will commonly be blue, green, or yellow. Like most parrot species,<br> 
            budgerigar plumage fluoresces under ultraviolet light &ndash; a phenomenon possibly related<br> 
            to courtship and mate selection.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">The upper half of their beaks is taller than the bottom half, covering the bottom when closed.<br> 
            The beak does not protrude much, due to the thick, fluffy feathers surrounding it, giving the<br> 
            appearance of a downward-pointing beak that lies flat against the face. The upper half acts as<br> 
            a long, smooth cover, while the bottom half is just about a half-sized cup-piece. These beaks<br> 
            allow the birds to eat plants, fruits, and vegetables.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">The colour of the cere differs between the sexes, being a lavender/baby blue in males, pale<br> 
            brownish/white &#40;non breeding&#41; to brown &#40;breeding&#41; in females, and pink in immature birds<br> 
            of both sexes &#40;usually of a more even purplish-pink colour in young males&#41;. Some female<br> 
            budgerigars develop a brown cere only during breeding time, which later returns to the normal<br> 
            colour. Young females can often be identified by a subtle, chalky whiteness that starts around<br>
            the nostrils. Males that are either albino, lutino, dark-eyed clear or recessive pied &#40;Danish<br> 
            pied or harlequin&#41; retain the immature purplish-pink cere colour for their entire lives.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Behaviours and head shape also help indicate sex. Veterinarians can determine the <br>
            sex of a bird by invasive examination or samples of blood, feather, or eggshell.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Mature males usually have a cere of light to dark blue, but in some particular<br> 
            colour mutations it can be periwinkle, lavender, purplish or pink &ndash; including dark-eyed clears,<br> 
            Danish pieds &#40;recessive pieds&#41; and inos, which usually display much rounder heads. The behaviour<br> 
            of males can distinguish them from females. Males are typically cheerful, extroverted, highly<br> 
            flirtatious, peacefully social, and very vocal.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Female ceres are pinkish-while immature. As they age, they move from being<br>
            beigeish or whitish outside breeding condition into brown &#40;often with a 'crusty' texture&#41; in<br> 
            breeding condition and usually display flattened backs of heads &#40;right above the nape&#41;. Females<br> 
            are more dominant and less socially tolerant. This behavior is more pronounced around other<br> 
            females than with males.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Budgerigars have 
            <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tetrachromatic" target="_blank"></a>tetrachromatic</a> 
            colour vision, although all four classes of cone cells will not<br> 
            operate simultaneously unless under sunlight or a UV lamp. The ultraviolet spectrum brightens their<br> 
            feathers to attract mates. The throat spots in budgerigars reflect UV and can be used to distinguish<br> 
            individual birds. While ultraviolet light is essential to the good health of caged and pet birds,<br>
            inadequate darkness or rest results in overstimulation.
